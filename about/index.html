    		About Me

  	<h2>
    		Who Am I? 
  	</h2>
	<p>
    		I am a Data Scientist with more than 4 years of experience in Research, Private and Financial Industries. I have experince in data collection, data management, data cleaning, data analysis, 
  		data visualization, machine learning, deep learning, credit scoring and database management. 
  	</p>
  	<p> 
    		I am a Masters graduate in Mathematical Sciences, with a major in Big Data and Financial Mathematics. Worth to note also is that I am an IBM and Microsoft Certified Data Analyst, Data Scientist and Machine Learning Expert.
  	</p>

    		My love for Data Science roots down to my study of Mathematics at the undergraduate level. Mathematics opened an eye for me to see that we can solve a lot of real world problems through modeling.
    		After Mathematical Modeling, the power of computers came in, where we can be able to represent those models in a language that a computer can understand and be able to get results in a short time. During this time, MATLAB was the main program we used to model mathematical equations.
    		During my Master studies, I was introdocuced to the Python programming language and Data Science. That is when I realized I was meant to be a data scientist.
  	</p>
  	<h2> Programming Languages and Projects </h2>
  	<p>
    		The main programming languages that I use are Python, R, SPSS, SQL, MATLAB and Julia. Recently, I have also started practicing Java for my own personal projects.

	    	One of my last breakthrough projects was a machine learning project that dealt with autonomous cars. It was a supervised machine learning problem where we were predicting the comfort of an individual using autonomous cars. 
	    		The main algorithms that we used were:
		    <ol>
		      <li>Logistic Regression</li>
		      <li>Support Vector Machines</li>
		      <li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
		      <li>Naive Bayes</li>
		      <li>Decision Trees and Random Forests</li>
		      <li>Neural Networks </li>
		    </ol>
		Additionally, in collaboration with Prof. Alois Pichler (Professorhip of Financial Mathematics, Faculty of Mathematics, Technical University of Chemnitz), we were able to generate and publish a Julia package:<a href="https://github.com/kirui93/ScenTrees.jl"> ScenTrees.jl</a> which is used for generating scenario trees and scenario lattices for multistage stochastic promgramming.
		We used stochastic approximation to provide algorithms for these processes. Additionally, we are providing a method of generating trajectories from an array of data using conditional density estimation.
		For more information, please visit the Package's documentation at <a href="https://kirui93.github.io/ScenTrees.jl/stable/"> https://kirui93.github.io/ScenTrees.jl/stable/</a> . The publication can also be found at <a href="https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01912"> https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01912</a>.

		On my daily work, I am involved in developing <b>credit scoring models</b> that are currently being used in a leading financial industry to award customers credit limits.
		These credit models have performed exceptionally well in terms of distinguishing good and bad customers that are joining the product. We have been able to <b>reduce the NPL rate from ~5% to ~2%</b>, hence the business is able to make profits.
		I have also built different <b>behavioral models</b> for the business. These models have been used to increase limits to customers who are performing well in the product.
