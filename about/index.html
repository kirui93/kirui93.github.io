  	<h2>
    		Who Am I? 
  	</h2>
	<p>
    		I am a Data Scientist with more than 4 years of experience. I have experince in data collection, data management, data cleaning, data analysis, 
  		data visualization, machine learning, deep learning and database management. 
  	</p>
  	<p> 
    		I am a Masters graduate in Mathematical Sciences, with a major in Big Data and Financial Mathematics. Worth to note also is that I am an IBM and Microsoft Certified Data Analyst, Data Scientist and Machine Learning Expert.
  	</p>

    		My love for Data Science roots down to my study of Mathematics at the undergraduate level. Mathematics opened an eye for me to see that we can solve a lot of real world problems through modeling.
    		After Mathematical Modeling, the power of computers came in, where we can be able to represent those models in a language that a computer can understand and be able to get results in a short time.
    		During my Masters studies, I was intrdocuced to the Python programming language and Data Science. Since then, I have not given up on it.
  	</p>
  	<h2> Programming Languages and Projects </h2>
  	<p>
    		The main programming languages that I use are Python, R, SPSS, SQL, MATLAB and Julia. 
  	</p>

    	One of my last breakthrough projects was a machine learning project that dealt with autonomous cars. It was a supervised machine learning problem where we were predicting the comfort of an individual using autonomous cars. 
    		The main algorithms that we used were:
	    <ol>
	      <li>Logistic Regression</li>
	      <li>Support Vector Machines</li>
	      <li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
	      <li>Naive Bayes</li>
	      <li>Decision Trees and Random Forests</li>
	      <li>Neural Networks </li>
	    </ol>
	Additionally, in collaboration with Prof. Alois Pichler (Professorhip of Financial Mathematics, Faculty of Mathematics, Technical University of Chemnitz), we were able to generate and publish a Julia package:<a href="https://github.com/kirui93/ScenTrees.jl"> ScenTrees.jl</a> which is used for generating scenario trees and scenario lattices for multistage stochastic promgramming.
	We used stochastic approximation to provide algorithms for these processes. Additionally, we are providing a method of generating trajectories from an array of data using conditional density estimation.
	For more information, please visit the Package's documentation at <a href="https://kirui93.github.io/ScenTrees.jl/stable/"> https://kirui93.github.io/ScenTrees.jl/stable/</a> .
