## Breakthough

Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

This is a huge breakthrough in my Data Science journey as I will be able to portray my abilities in the various blogs with projects that I will be posting here.

There are a lot to come. So, stay tuned.

## What You will see

There are a lot coming up on this site:
1. Blogs on Data Science
2. Blogs on Machine Learning
3. Knowledge projects on Machine Learning and Data Science
